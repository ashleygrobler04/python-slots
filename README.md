# python-slots
A slot machine for your terminal

## How does this work?

The slot machine has 3 wheels. Each time you spin, each wheel lands on a symbol. Your goal is to get each wheel on the same symbol with luck. If you do so, you win double your bet.

## How do you play?


First of all, make sure you have python installed. Any version should work, as long as it is version 3.x.
You can just run the file like you would run any python file and enjoy!

Options include:

* spin, spins the wheels,
* bet, change your bet,
* resetChips, reset your chips to 100,
* and exit, quits the game and prints out a friendly message
